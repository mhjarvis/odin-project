    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Chicken schnitzel is a breeze to make in the oven. Plus, this method uses less oil and has easier cleanup. The breaded chicken breasts are baked until golden and crispy on the outside, yet they're still tender and juicy on the inside. Serve schnitzels with lemon wedges and a German-style potato salad.</p>
